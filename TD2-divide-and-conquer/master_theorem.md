### The master theorem :
The Master Theorem is a mathematical tool used for analyzing the time complexity of divide-and-conquer algorithms. It provides a straightforward way to determine the asymptotic running time of algorithms with a recurring structure, particularly those that split the problem into subproblems and combine their solutions.


$$ T(n) = aT\left(\frac{n}{b}\right) + f(n) $$

where $ f(n) = \Theta(n^c) $
- If  $ c < \log_b a  : T(n) = \Theta(n^{\log_b a} $
- If $ c = \log_b a  :  T(n) = \Theta(n^c \log^{k+1} n) $
- If $c > \log_b a : T(n) = \Theta(f(n)) $

### Divide and conquer : 
Divide and Conquer is a fundamental algorithmic paradigm that involves solving a problem by breaking it down into smaller subproblems, solving each subproblem independently, and then combining the solutions to the subproblems to obtain the solution to the original problem. The general approach follows these steps:

- Divide:
Break the problem into smaller, more manageable subproblems. This step involves partitioning the input into two or more smaller instances of the same problem. Each subproblem should be of a similar or identical form to the original problem.
- Conquer:
Solve each subproblem independently. This is often done recursively, either by applying the divide-and-conquer approach iteratively or by making recursive calls to solve the subproblems. If the subproblems are small enough, solve them directly using a base case.
- Combine:
Take the solutions to the subproblems and combine them to get the solution to the original problem. This step typically involves merging or aggregating the results obtained from the conquered subproblems.
#### Examples of application : 
1. Merge Sort:
Divide: Split the array into two halves.
Conquer: Recursively sort each half.
Combine: Merge the two sorted halves into a single sorted array.
2. QuickSort:
Divide: Choose a pivot element and partition the array into two subarrays - elements less than the pivot and elements greater than the pivot.
Conquer: Recursively sort the subarrays.
Combine: No explicit combine step is needed; the sorting is done in place.
3. Binary Search:
